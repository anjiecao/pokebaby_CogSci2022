abstract: >
    Include no author information in the initial submission, to facilitate
    blind review.  The abstract should be one paragraph, indented 1/8 inch on both sides,
    in 9~point font with single spacing. The heading 'Abstract'
    should be 10~point, bold, centered, with one line of space below
    it. This one-paragraph abstract section is required only for standard
    six page proceedings papers. Following the abstract should be a blank
    line, followed by the header 'Keywords' and a list of
    descriptive keywords separated by semicolons, all in 9~point font, as
    shown below.
    
keywords: >
    Add your choice of indexing terms or keywords; kindly use a semi-colon; between each term.
