The current work aimed to provide a computational model that can explain the three key phenomena observed in typical infant looking time paradigms: habituation, dishabituation, and complexity effect. RANCH assumes a rational learner that takes noisy perceptual samples from stimuli and makes sampling decisions based on expected information gain. We evaluated the model with adult looking time data collected from a paradigm that mirrors classic infant looking time paradigms. We found that RANCH can successfully reproduce the patterns observed in behavioral data. We find that other information theoretic quantities (e.g. KL-divergence and Surprisal) are good proxies for the rational learning policy. Moreover, by contrasting the model results with our baseline models, we showed that habituation, dishabituation, and complexity effects only arise in a learning model that takes into account the noisy nature of perception. 

RANCH constitutes a significant step forward in the modeling of looking time in that it models the moment-to-moment decision making process of whether to keep sampling or look away. This is in contrast to previous approaches, which incremented time in steps of whole stimuli, and therefore can merely correlate information-theoretic variability in the stimulus sequence to looking time. Our mechanistic account of the sampling process depended on the assumption that perception is noisy, which made it necessary to take multiple samples from a stimulus until the information content of the stimulus has been learned. The moment-to-moment increments in which RANCH operates also enabled us to use EIG as a linking hypothesis between learning and sampling. Using EIG allowed us to perform the rational analysis of human behavior in our paradigm, and contrast it with easier-to-compute and psychologically plausible linking hypothesis, surprisal and KL.

There are several limitations to our work. For our behavioral data, one concern is that our self-paced visual presentation task might not be capturing participants’ intrinsic interests in exploring the stimuli. Adults may be viewing the stimuli in preparation for tasks, which deviates from the infant looking duration primarily driven by intrinsic motivation. However, across our three conditions with different filler tasks, we found no differences in looking time patterns. This suggests that the recorded behaviors are independent of task demand and are likely tapping into the same processes that produce infants’ looking time patterns. 

In regards to the model, a few concerns can be raised about the current implementation.  First of all, the current stimulus representation is rather oversimplified. The stimuli are represented as a collection of binary features. We did not take into consideration how perceptual features can be processed with different priorities. Our complex stimuli are different from simple stimuli not only in the number of perceptual features but also in the kinds of features, such as eyes. There are studies showing that features like eyes might be particularly interesting to viewers because they convey potential social information and serve as strong cues for animacy [@birmingham2009saliency; @anderson2018animacy]. Properly representing different cognitive consequences of different types of features could be an interesting next step for the model. In addition, RANCH assumes that looking duration is determined by the decision between “continue looking” and “look away”. However, one can argue that in the behavioral experiment the participants were deciding between “continuing looking at the current stimulus” and “looking at the next stimulus”. Building in these more sophisticated assumptions into the model would certainly help us better understand looking time under a rational analysis framework. But as a first step, our current work suggests that a simple rational learner that takes noisy samples from a  set of independent binary features is capable of explaining key phenomena in looking time change. 

Our ultimate goal is to provide a rational learner model that can account for information seeking behaviors through the lens of infants’ looking time. Here we have shown that such a model can reproduce adults’ looking time changes. As we further elaborate on our modeling approach, our ongoing work with infants will eventually help address the developmental trajectories of the mechanisms through which learners decide what to look at, and when to stop looking.
