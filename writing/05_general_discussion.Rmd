The current work aimed to provide a computational model that can explain key phenomena observed in typical infant looking time paradigms: habituation, dishabituation, and how these are modified by stimulus complexity. RANCH assumes a rational learner that takes noisy perceptual samples from stimuli and makes sampling decisions based on EIG. We evaluated the model with adult looking time data collected from a paradigm that mirrors classic infant looking time paradigms, in which participants are learning about multi-feature concepts and found that RANCH could successfully reproduce the patterns observed in behavioral data. By contrasting the model results with our baseline models, we showed that habituation, dishabituation, and complexity effects only arise in a learning model that takes into account the noisy nature of perception. Moreover, we found that, in the current learning context, other information theoretic quantities (surprisal and KL) are good proxies for the optimal linking hypothesis, EIG.

RANCH constitutes a significant step forward in the modeling of looking time in that it models the moment-to-moment decision making process of whether to keep sampling or look away. Previous approaches incremented time in steps of whole stimuli and therefore correlated information-theoretic variability in the stimulus sequence to look-away probability and looking time, rather than producing these behaviors endogenously. Our account of the sampling process depends on assuming that perception is noisy, which makes it necessary to take multiple samples from a stimulus until the information content of the stimulus has been learned sufficiently. 

The similarity between model fits among models with different linking hypotheses highlights the significance of learning contexts. Our results should not be interpreted as evidence showing that the three linking hypotheses are indistinguishable across all learning contexts. Previous work has shown that adopting surprisal as learning policy can lead to undesirable behaviors in artificial agents [e.g. “the white noise problem”, @oudeyer2007intrinsic]. Moreover, the two alternative linking hypotheses are backward-looking metrics that utilize past heuristics to make decisions. This characteristic could constrain their application to situations in which the environment is stable and the cost of sampling is low. Since adult exploration is sensitive to environmental complexity, a forward-looking metric like EIG might be particularly suitable to predict behaviors in a more dynamic learning context [@dubey2020reconciling; @vogelstein2022prospective].

There are several limitations to our work. For our behavioral data, one concern is that adult looking time might not be driven by intrinsic interest to the same degree as infant looking time. Rather, they might be driven by task-preparation. However, across the three conditions with different cover tasks, we found no differences in looking time patterns.  In regards to the model, a few concerns can be raised. First, the current stimulus representation is oversimplified, using an unweighted collection of binary features. Future research could apply RANCH to stimulus representations generated from a perceptual model. Second, RANCH assumes that the EIG from the environment is a constant throughout the experiment, but one can argue that environmental EIG might increase as the experiment progresses (e.g. the longer you haven’t attended to the things in your surrounding, the more they may have changed in the meantime). While implementing more sophisticated assumptions could potentially explain additional variance in the data, our current work suggests that even a simple rational learner that takes noisy samples from a set of independent binary features is capable of explaining key phenomena. 

Our ultimate goal is to provide a rational learner model that can account for information seeking behaviors reflected in infants’ looking time. Here we have shown that a simple model of learning from sampling can reproduce habituation, dishabituation, and complexity effects. Moving forward, we aim to capture and explain more contentious phenomena documented in the infant looking time literature such as familiarity preferences and age effects (Hunter & Ames, 1988). Our ongoing work with infants will eventually enable us to evaluate our model with developmental data. When combined with adult results, the data and model will provide insights into the general mechanisms through which learners decide what to look at, and when to stop looking.
